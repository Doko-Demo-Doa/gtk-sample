# gtk-sample

A simple UI program, written in Rust, to show a dead simple button within a window. Can be compiled and runs on Windows, Mac, Linux.

It was born from my needs to learn Rust, starting from small UI development using GTK.

You can read my [blog post](https://doko.aniviet.com/blog/rust-gtk-on-windows-getting-started/) here about the inspiration and other things that I bumped when creating this app.
